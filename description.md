CS Net Test
Cloudstaff Network Tester is a great tool for testing internet connectivity on your Android device. CS Net Test will report the Type of Internet connection you have, check that DNS is working, run a Ping Test and finally perform a HTTP connection test.  It is particularly useful if you are not sure if your phoneâ€™s data plan is working - your phone may appear to be connected to the mobile data network but your Telco is blocking access because you have reached your data cap. CS Net Test is free and we are happy to customise a version for your business. Just email hello@Cloudstaff.com
